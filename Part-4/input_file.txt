Hadoop is an open-source framework that provides distributed storage and processing capabilities for handling large volumes of data across clusters of computers. It was initially developed by Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella in 2005 and is now maintained by the Apache Software Foundation.
Key components of the Hadoop framework include:
Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): HDFS is a distributed file system that stores data across multiple machines in a cluster. It is designed to handle large files and provides high fault tolerance by replicating data across multiple nodes.
MapReduce: MapReduce is a programming model used for processing and analyzing large datasets in parallel across a cluster. It divides the data into smaller chunks, performs distributed processing on each chunk, and then combines the results. MapReduce provides fault tolerance, scalability, and automatic data distribution.
YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator): YARN is a resource management framework in Hadoop. It manages and allocates resources (CPU, memory, etc.) across the cluster and allows different data processing frameworks, such as MapReduce, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink, to run on the same Hadoop cluster.
Hadoop Common: Hadoop Common contains libraries and utilities used by other Hadoop components. It provides a set of common functionalities and interfaces required by various Hadoop modules.
Hadoop Ecosystem: Hadoop has a rich ecosystem of additional tools and frameworks that work with or on top of the core components. Examples include Apache Hive (data warehouse infrastructure), Apache Pig (data analysis platform), Apache HBase (distributed NoSQL database), Apache Spark (in-memory data processing), Apache Kafka (distributed streaming platform), and many others.
The primary advantages of Hadoop are its scalability, fault tolerance, and ability to process large amounts of data across a cluster of commodity hardware. It enables organizations to store, process, and analyze vast datasets in a cost-effective and efficient manner. Hadoop is widely used in various domains, including data analytics, machine learning, scientific research, log processing, and processing of large-scale web data.
